This is a python discord music bot that supports only youtube. It uses discord.py and yt-dlp. 

You will await the user prompt. THen you will proceed to read plan.md and memory.md to see what as to be done and what was done already. You will then execute the task with todo. You will create a todo of the tasks to do in the user story.

After each user story, we will test the bot with a docker-compose local build and run. 

After each task, you will append memory.md with what you have accomplished.
