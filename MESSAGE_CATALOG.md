## Implementation Notes

1. All command responses should use `ephemeral=True`
2. All command responses should use standardized embed templates
3. DM messages should use standardized embed templates but remain as DMs
4. Public control panel embeds should remain unchanged
5. Error messages should be consistent and helpful
